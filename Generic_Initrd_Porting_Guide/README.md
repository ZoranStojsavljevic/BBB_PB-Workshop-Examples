The aouthor of this repository thinks that for the featured context, the presented examples:

	initrd_example_1/ (as failed example, NOT to be fixed)
	initrd_example_2/ (as succesful working example)

Would represent the minimum requirements for the given repo context.

Thus, the both examples will stay as they are presently for the time being.

I would like to thank you all for the understanding!
